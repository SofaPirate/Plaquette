Plaquette
=========

Plaquette is an object-oriented, user-friendly, signal-centric programming
framework for **creative physical computing** compatible with Arduino. Plaquette
provides a simple yet powerful interface, allowing both beginner and advanced
creative practitioners to design expressive physical computing systems in an intuitive way.

Plaquette allows you to:
 * React to multiple sensors and actuators in real-time without interruption.
 * Automatically calibrate sensors to generate stable interactions in changing environments.
 * Design complex interactive behaviors by seamlessly combining powerful effects such as ramps and oscillators.
