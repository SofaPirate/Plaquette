Plaquette is an object-oriented, user-friendly, signal-centric programming
framework for **creative physical computing**. It promotes **expressiveness** over
technical details while remaining fully compatible with `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_,
thus allowing **both novice and experienced** creative practitioners to **intuitively** design 
meaningful physical interactive systems.

Whether you are a beginner working with physical computing for the first time, an intermediate user 
familiar with creative signal-based softwares (eg. Max, Ossia Score, PureData, SuperCollider, 
TouchDesigner, etc.), or a seasoned Arduino creative coder: Plaquette is the perfect tool for your 
creative embedded and IoT projects.

Plaquette allows you to:

 * React to multiple sensors and actuators in real-time without interruption.
 * Automatically calibrate sensors to design stable interactions in changing environments.
 * Design rich interactive behaviors by seamlessly combining powerful effects.
