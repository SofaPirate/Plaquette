# Trigger on 'push' on all branches.
#
# Some may find adding 'pull_request' to be useful (see
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request).
# But this may cause duplicate workflow iterations. Then consider restricting
# the 'push' event to just the master branch, like this:
#
# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#     -master
#   pull_request:
#
on: [push]
