          # Not all libraries include examples or unit tests.  The default
          #  behavior of arduino_ci is to assume that "if the files don't
          #  exist, then they were not MEANT to exist".  In other words,
          #  if you were to accidentally delete all your tests or example
          #  sketches, then the CI runner would by default assume that was
          #  intended and return a passing result.
          #
          # If you'd rather have the test runner fail the test in the
          #  absence of either tests or examples, uncommenting either of
          #  the following variables to 'true' (as appropriate) will
          #  enforce that.

          # Although dependencies will be installed automatically via the
          # library manager, your library under test may require an
          # unofficial version of a dependency.  In those cases, the custom
          # libraries must be installed prior to the test execution; those
          # installation commands should be placed in a shell script (that
          # will be executed by /bin/sh) stored in your library.
          #
          # Then, set this variable to the path to that file (relative to
          # the root of your repository).  The script will be run from
          # within the Arduino libraries directory; you should NOT attempt
          # to find that directory nor change to it from within the script.
