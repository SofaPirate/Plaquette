Plaquette
=========

Plaquette is an object-oriented, user-friendly, signal-centric programming
framework for **creative physical computing**. It promotes **expressiveness** over
technical details while remaining fully compatible with `Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>`_,
thus allowing **both beginner and advanced** creative practitioners to design meaningful
physical computing systems in an intuitive fashion.

Plaquette allows you to:
 * React to multiple sensors and actuators in real-time without interruption.
 * Automatically calibrate sensors to generate stable interactions in changing environments.
 * Design complex interactive behaviors by seamlessly combining powerful effects.
