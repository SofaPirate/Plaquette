Community Guidelines
====================

Plaquette is an open-source software used by artists, makers, researchers, and developers interested
in creative computation. The goal of these guidelines is to help everyone collaborate and
communicate in a friendly and inclusive way — whether you are reporting a bug, suggesting a
feature, or sharing your ideas.

If you participate in any Plaquette space (issues, pull requests, or discussions on GitHub),
please take a moment to read and follow these principles.

----

Be Respectful and Inclusive

Everyone is welcome, regardless of experience level, background, or identity.
We ask that you be kind, patient, and supportive of others’ learning processes.

All interactions on GitHub are covered by the
`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/SofaPirate/Plaquette/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_.

If you ever experience or witness behavior that makes you uncomfortable, please reach out to the
maintainers directly.

Reporting Bugs and Requesting Features
======================================

To make it easier for everyone:

* First, check the existing issues on GitHub to see if your topic already exists.

  - **💡 Feature idea** — you’d like to suggest an improvement.
  - **🙋 Help needed** — you’re stuck and need a hand.
  - **✏️ Quick note** — a short comment, idea, or thought.

All discussions happen transparently on the
`issues tracker <https://github.com/SofaPirate/Plaquette/issues>`_.

----

Getting Support
===============

If you need help using Plaquette:

* Start by browsing the documentation at https://plaquette.org/
