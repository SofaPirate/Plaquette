Fields
======

Field units represent a spatial function over the normalized range [0, 1]. Unlike typical arrays indexed by
integers, a field is sampled using fractional positions and returns a value based on internal logic or data.
Fields are useful for plotting, shaping, transforming, or visualizing signals across space.
