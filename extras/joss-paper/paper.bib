  abstract = {Arduino is the open source electronics prototyping platform that is the heart of the Maker world. This thorough introduction, updated for the latest Arduino IDE release and the new ARM-based boards, helps you start prototyping right away. From obtaining the required components to putting the final touches on your project, all the information you need is here!  Getting started with the Arduino is a snap! To use the introductory examples in this guide, all you need is an Arduino Uno or Nano, along with a USB cable and an LED. The easy-to-use, free Arduino development environment runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux.  Join hundreds of thousands of hobbyists who have discovered this incredible (and educational) platform.  In Getting Started with Arduino, you will learn about: Interaction design and physical computingThe Arduino board and its software environmentBasics of electricity and electronicsPrototyping on a solderless breadboardDrawing a schematic diagramUsing the Cloud IDE and the new Arduino IoT CloudBuilding a custom plant-watering systemMaking a WiFi-enabled internet fistbump Written by Massimo Banzi, the co-founder of Arduino and Michael Shiloh, Arduino educational lead.},

Our aim is to provide more clarity about the nature of practice-based research, the approach we advocate and how it contributes to new knowledge that can be shared and scrutinized in a form that is both accessible and rich in its representation of the full scope of creative arts research. We draw on examples spanning over 35 years of experience in supervising interdisciplinary PhD research programs in the arts, design and digital media.},
